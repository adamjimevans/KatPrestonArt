            <p class="bio">Kat Preston is an emerging multidisciplinary artist based in the Shropshire Hills, who has recently expanded her artistic practice to include ceramics, sculpture and painting. Her work primarily focuses on the female form and explores the female psyche as a way to express her emotions. 

                Preston's style is a unique blend of abstract and figurative elements, and she uses organic shapes and textures to create pieces that are visually striking and emotionally powerful. Her recent transition into ceramics has allowed her to explore new dimensions in her work, adding a tactile quality that further enhances the emotional impact of her pieces. 
                
                Despite being early in her career, Preston has already exhibited her work in galleries and museums throughout the UK, and has gained a following among private collectors.  
                
                As she continues to explore new mediums and push the boundaries of her artistic practice. Her unique artistic vision, technical skill, and ability to connect with audiences make her an artist to watch in the coming years.

                About me:
                
                After a long time living in the creative, fast pace hub of Manchester, I have now uprooted back to my home county of Shropshire and work from a studio based in Shropshire’s AONB. 
                
                As well as my own practice, I also work in creating props, scenic and décor for outdoor events, festival and venues.</p>
